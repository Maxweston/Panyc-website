About

We realise that some pegs are just too square to fit! You may require some additional functioning to be added to our standard products, or maybe a whole new process. Whatever your need we can handcraft a software solution for you. Most situations call for a database somewhere in the system be it on a web server or held locally. We have been offering expert database solutions internationally to industry and commerce since 1987. Since then other technologies have been developed and we have embraced them where appropriate so that we can offer you the best of web enabled methods.

When it comes to specifying what you want, we can work in a number of ways. This can range from a formal specification to just discussing a rough idea and letting the project evolve. In fact some our most powerful systems have been seeded on 'the back of a cigarette packet' and then developed by the reflux method. If you would like a free consultation and estimate of cost for getting your project up and running, just give me a call or email. Chris Weston Proprietor PANYC Software
